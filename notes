regular expression are used in transforms and search rules to match dialed strings or URI

Match any uri
reges .*
matches all strings

Match digits only
Regex ^\d +$
matches any numeric stirng

Match 4-digit Extensions
Regex : ^(\d{4})$
matches exactly 4 digits

match specific domain
regex: .*@example.com
matches any URI ending with @example.com

Strip leading digits and replace
Regex ^9(\d+)$
Replacement \1
Removes leading 9 from dialed numbers

How to use regex in expressway
-> use regex in Transforms to modify dialed URIs
-> Use regex in Search Rules to match specific call patterns for routing


Configuration Example: End-to-End Call Routing
Element 
Transform -> match ^(\d{4})$ -> replace \1@example.com (convert 4 digit extensions to SIP URI)

Search Rule 
Pattern .*@example.com -> Route to CUCM_Neighbor Zone

Neighbor Zone
Create a neighbor zone pointing to CUCM`s IP/FQDN with SIP enabled

Regular Expression 
Used in bot transforms and search rules to match and manipulate dialed numbers/URIs


Configure B2B Business-to-Business collaboration solution using Cisco Expressway and integrating with CUCM


1) DNS Record (Focus on Microsoft DNS)
Configure DNS to enable proper routing for SIP-based B2B communication

a) Create "A" Records
-> Create A records for expressway-E external IP or FQDN
Record Name: expressway-e.example.com
IP address : External IP of Expressway-E

b) Create SRV records
-> Create SRV records for SIP services
Service: _sip
protocol: _tcp or _tls
priority: 10
weight: 10 
Port: 5061
Target: expressway-e.example.com

Example DNS Records:
Record Type
A records
Name -> expressway-e 
Value 203.0.113.10

SRV Record
_sip._tls.example.com
10 10 5061 expressway-e.example.com

Using CLI
nslookup -type=srv _sip._tls.example.com


2 CERTIFICATES (Focus on Microsoft CA)
Objective 
Secure TLS communication for SIP traffic using certificates issued by a Microsoft Certificate Authority (CA)
Steps:
1) Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):
On Expressway-C and Expressway-E, navigation part
Maintenece > Security Ceritifcate > Server Certificates

2) Generate a CSR, including
Common Name (CN): FQDN of the expressway (eg. expressway-e.example.com)
Subject Alternate Names (SANs): All relevant domains for B2B communication (e.g. example.com , sip.example.com)

3) Submit the CSR to Microsoft CA:
-> Use the Microsoft CA web interface (https://<CA-Server>/certsrv)
-> Choose Web Server Certificate template

4) Install the Certificate
On expressway, upload the signed server certificate and the CA root/intermediate certificates

5) Enable TLS;
-> Ensure SIP traffic uses TLS on port 5061


verification:
-> use openSSL to test certificate
openssl s_client -connect expressway-e.example.com:5061


Traversal Zones
-> Enable secure traversal of SIP signaling and media traffic between Expressway-C and Expressway-E 
Steps
On Expressway-C
navigate to configuration > zones > zones
Create a traversal client zone
Name : Traversal_Client
Peer Address : FQDN or IP of Expressway-E
Authentication : Enter shared credentials (configured on Expressway-E)

2) On Expressway-E
Navigate to configuration > zones > ZOnes
Create traversal server zone
name traversal_server
authentication: same credentials as configured on Expressway-C

Verification:
-> Check zone status under status > zones both zones should display Active



Negibor zones
set up neighbor zones for direct communication with external or internal systems like cucm or other sip servers
navigate to zones configuration
go to configuration > zones > zones

Create a neighbor zone
Name: CUCM_Neighbor
SIP Mode: Enable SIP
Peer Address: IP address or FQDN of CUCM
Port ; 5061 (TCP) or 5061(TLS)
Authentication: configure credentials if required

Verification:
Test connectivity using diagnostics > zone status


-> Transforms
Modify dialed number or SIP URIs for proper routing
Navigation
-> go to transforms
configuration > dial plan > transforms

Create a new transform rule:
-> Name : Add Domain
-> pattern string: ^(\d{4})$ (matches 4 digit numbers)

replacement string \1@example.com (appends domain)

Verification
-> Test transforms using the diagnostics tools

-> Search rules
Route calls to the appropriate zone based on the dialed URI

Go to search rules
-> Navigate to configuration > dial plan > search rules

Create a new search rule
-> Name Route_to_CUCM
-> Priority : 1
-> Pattern String : .*@example.com
-> Target Zone: CUCM_Neighbor


verification
use Diagnostics > Search history to confirm call routing

SIP Trunk intergration with Cisco UCM
Integrate CUCM with expressway for sip-based communication
on CUCM
-> Navigate to Device > trunk > add new
-> Device Name: EXPWY_TRUNK
-> Trunk Type : SIP Trun
-> Destination Address : FQDN/IP  of Expressway-C
-> SIP port : 5061
-> Security Profile: SIP Trunk with TLS

2) On expressway-C:
-> Ensure a neighbor zone points to cucm


3) Configure Route Patterns;
-> add route patterns on cucm to route calls via the Expressway trunk


verification
-> place test calls and verify call signaling under:
Diagnostics > SIP Messages


Summary of Configuration Elements
dns records -> configure A and SRV records for Expressway-E

Certificates -. use Microsoft CA to generate and install certificates

Traversal Zones -> create client and server zones between expressway-C and Expressway-E

neighbor Zones -> Set up zoens for communication with cucm or other SIP servers

Transforms: Modify dial strings or SIP URIs for routing

Search Rules : define rules to route calls to the appropriate zones or destiantions

SIP trunks (CUCM) Create a SIP trunk on CUCM pointing to Expressway-C
